No wonder it is hailed as a masterpiece of Odisha Temple Architecture. Historians speculate that it was called Indresvara Temple and dedicated to Lord Shiva.Today the temple today is devoid of any presiding deity, there are telltale signs in the architecture of the temple to corroborate that it was a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, the most notable one being the carving of sage Lakulisa just above the entrance door and below the navagrahas.","Based on the sculptural architectural style, the temple is dated to the mid-11th century. Brown groups the temple along with Anant Vasudev Temple and places it around the 11th–12th centuries. :Another survey of Orissa temples carried out by S. K. Saraswati in 1953 yielded a similar date. Panigrahi, who did a comprehensive analysis of Orissan temples, gives an unspecified date between Lingaraj Temple and Mukteswara Temple. :Fergusson believes construction of the temple was begun by around 1105. George Michell believes the temple was built during the same time as Lingaraja Temple. Rajarani Temple roughly belongs to the same period as the Jagannath Temple at Puri. :The architecture of other temples in central India originated from this temple. The notable ones in the category are the Khajuraho temples and Totesvara Mahadeo temple in Kadawa. Scholars believe based on the style that the temple might have been built by Somavamsi kings who migrated from Central Indis to Orissa during the period. :The temple is known as Rajarani Temple, because of the red and yellow sandstone called Rajarania that was used in its construction. With passage of time, the stone imparts an amber shade which accentuates the architectural beauty of the temple. :The structural plan of the temple resembles the Kandariya Mahadev Temple of Khajuraho which can be attributed to the fact that the Somavamsi’s came to Odisha from Central India. :The temple has another interesting feature which is unique in the temple architecture of Odisha, i.e the tower over the Sanctum Sanctorum rises from the ground like a beehive with smaller miniature towers, one on top of the other merging seamlessly with it, just like a mountain range where the peak is surrounded by smaller mountains. This might well be symbolic of the yearning of the human soul trying to reach higher and higher till it merges with the eternal almighty spirit. :Rajarani temple is great testament to the skillset, infinite patience and perseverance of the architects and their patrons.",https://i.imgur.com/XOBo4a0.jpg,https://i.imgur.com/R0ZEqs1.jpg https://i.imgur.com/9cjf7ZD.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jJIE6CU.jpg https://i.imgur.com/dXgs3ov.jpg https://i.imgur.com/NWiGVY3.jpg

A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear over the door to the inner sanctum as the later temples portray nine. :The temple derives its name from the penance of Parasuram and the grace of Lord Shiva, who is worshiped as Parasurameswar. :The interesting feature of the temple is the presence of the “Saptmatrikas”- who are always represented together. They represent the powers that bestowed on Shakti by various gods. In essence it indicates every woman who is a mother inherits the powers of Shakti. :The Saptamatrikas are Brahmani (from Brahma), Vaishnavi (from Vishnu), Maheshi/Rudrani/Maheswari (from Shiva), Chamunda (from Devi), Kaumari (from warrior god Skanda), Indrani (from Indra) and Barahi (from Baraha). :The carvings of eight grahas (planets without ketu) at the entrance to the deula (The later temples have nava grahas (nine planets)) along with its “triratha” architectural plan and a jagamohana which is crudely joined with the deula indicates its antiquity.",https://i.imgur.com/OuQfYgy.jpg,https://i.imgur.com/GR9k2mi.png https://i.imgur.com/B8OBkVK.jpg https://i.imgur.com/XuaZL5p.jpg

The yogini cult practiced yoga along with tantrism. The object of worship was usually a Chakra or Wheel which had sixty four spokes, hence the name (Chausathi translates to sixty four in Odia). The presiding deity is Goddess Kali. The yogini’s are believed to be offshoots of the Saptamatrika and are incarnations of Shakti and depicted as vivacious and seem to embrace life rather than withdraw from it. ","There are four surviving yogini temples in the country. Out of the four such temples two are located in Odisha (one in Hirapur and the other one in Ranipur-Jharial in Bolangir Dist and the other two are in modern day Madhya Pradesh). :The temple was discovered in 1953 by noted historian Shri. Kedarnath Mohapatra who was the curator of the Odisha State Museum then. It is the smallest and the best preserved of the yogini temples in the country. :It was built in the 9th century AD and has been attributed to Queen Hiradevi, mother of King Subhakar Dev II of the Bhaumakar dynasty. :The legend behind the temple according to local priests is of the Goddess Durga taking the form of 64 demi-goddesses in order to defeat a demon. After the fight the 64 goddesses (Joginis) asked Durga to commemorate them in the form of a temple structure. :The yogini’s define and represent the ultimate feminine power. The circular open air structure is a stark departure from the tradition form of temple architecture in Odisha. This may have been necessitated by the fact that the cult worshipped the five elements – air, water, fire, earth and ether or sky. The yoginis are carved out of black slate stone and are depicted riding their vahanas (mounts) here. :One interesting aspect of the temple is that unlike other temples of that time in Odisha and Central India, one doesn’t find any erotic carvings in the yogini temples which according to historians may have been because the cult believed in celibacy as a path to salvation.",https://i.imgur.com/JADYQ6b.jpg ,https://i.imgur.com/v6yOUKw.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nKdfxX9.jpg https://i.imgur.com/V4gkfDd.jpg https://i.imgur.com/KRyvEvk.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Rboq3JW.jpg

","Students of history place the sanctuary to have a place with the late eleventh century as learned from an engraving conveyed to Calcutta from Bhubaneswar. The engraving demonstrates that the sanctuary was worked by Kolavatidevi, the mother of Somavamsi ruler Udyota Kesari. It was worked with four Natyasalas at a spot known as Siddhatirtha in Ekamra (present day Bhubaneswar). :The engraving was recorded during the eighteenth renal year of Udyotha Kesari, comparing to 1060 CE. Since the engraving isn't in its unique spot, history specialists demonstrate the chance of the reference to another sanctuary, however dependent on the area and different highlights indicated, it is learned that the engraving has a place with the sanctuary. :Additionally, another issue raised by Panigrahi is that the four cardinal sanctuaries are Angasalas (partner sanctuaries) and not Natyasalas (ballrooms) as demonstrated in the engraving. :The sanctuary by virtue of its later source, has entirely evolved structure contrasted with its forerunners. The vimana of the sanctuary is 18.96 m (62.2 ft) tall. The sanctuary is worked with conventional structural techniques for wood cutting, yet applied on stone structure.
